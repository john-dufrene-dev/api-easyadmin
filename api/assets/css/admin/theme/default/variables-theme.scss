/* ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   This file defines the CSS variables used in the backend design.
   Most of the times, overriding some of these variables is all you need to
   customize the design of your backends. However, because of how Bootstrap 3
   works, some styles can't be customized with CSS variables and you'll need
   to also customize the Sass variables defined in bootstrap-variables.scss.
